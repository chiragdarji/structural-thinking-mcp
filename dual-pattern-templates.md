# ðŸš€ Dual-Pattern MCP Workflow Templates

## ðŸ”„ Pattern 1: Analysis-First (Structure â†’ Sequential â†’ Structure)

### Template Command Sequence:
```bash
# Step 1: Structural Analysis
st_refine "[your initial problem/question]" --json true

# Step 2: Sequential Deep Dive  
sequentialthinking "[use refined prompt from step 1]"

# Step 3: Structural Validation
st_refine "validate and analyze the sequential thinking results above for completeness and gaps" --json true
```

### Best For:
- âœ… Well-defined problems
- âœ… Complex analysis requiring systematic coverage
- âœ… Technical implementation planning
- âœ… Risk assessment and validation

---

## ðŸ”„ Pattern 2: Exploration-First (Sequential â†’ Structure â†’ Sequential)

### Template Command Sequence:
```bash
# Step 1: Sequential Exploration
sequentialthinking "explore [your problem] from multiple angles and discover creative approaches"

# Step 2: Structural Gap Analysis  
st_refine "analyze the exploration above for gaps, missing perspectives, and areas needing deeper investigation" --json true

# Step 3: Sequential Gap Filling
sequentialthinking "[use refined prompt from step 2 to fill identified gaps]"
```

### Best For:
- âœ… Unclear or ambiguous problems
- âœ… Creative problem solving
- âœ… Discovery and innovation
- âœ… Brainstorming and ideation

## âš¡ Dual-Pattern Power Multiplication

### Full Workflow (Both Patterns):
```bash
# Phase 1: Analysis-First Pattern
st_refine "[problem]" --json true
sequentialthinking "[refined prompt]"
st_refine "validate analysis above" --json true

# Phase 2: Exploration-First Pattern
sequentialthinking "explore creative alternatives to: [problem]"
st_refine "analyze exploration gaps above" --json true  
sequentialthinking "[refined exploration prompt]"

# Phase 3: Synthesis
st_refine "synthesize and compare the systematic analysis with creative exploration above to create optimal solution" --json true
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Start Examples

### Example 1: Business Problem
**Problem:** "Increase customer retention"

**Pattern 1 (Analysis-First):**
```
st_refine "Increase customer retention" --json true
â†’ Get structured framework for retention analysis

sequentialthinking "[refined retention analysis prompt]"  
â†’ Get systematic analysis of retention factors

st_refine "validate retention analysis for gaps" --json true
â†’ Get completeness validation
```

**Pattern 2 (Exploration-First):**
```
sequentialthinking "explore creative customer retention strategies"
â†’ Get innovative retention ideas

st_refine "analyze retention exploration for gaps" --json true
â†’ Get structured gap analysis

sequentialthinking "[refined exploration prompt]"
â†’ Get comprehensive creative solutions
```

### Example 2: Technical Problem
**Problem:** "Optimize database performance"

**Use Full Dual-Pattern approach for maximum coverage**

## ðŸ“‹ Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Pattern 1 (Analysis-First):
- You need systematic, comprehensive coverage
- Problem is well-defined but complex
- Risk management is critical
- Compliance/standards must be met

### When to Use Pattern 2 (Exploration-First):
- Problem is unclear or poorly defined
- Innovation and creativity are needed
- Multiple stakeholder perspectives required
- Breakthrough solutions desired

### When to Use Both (Power Multiplication):
- Critical decisions
- Complex, high-stakes problems
- Need both systematic coverage AND creative innovation
- Want maximum confidence in solution quality
