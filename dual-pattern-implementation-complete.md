## 🛠️ **How to Use Your System**

### **Quick Start Command:**
```bash
# For any problem, use this sequence:
st_refine "[your problem]" --json true
sequentialthinking "[refined prompt from above]"
st_refine "validate analysis above for gaps" --json true
sequentialthinking "explore creative approaches to: [your problem]"
st_refine "analyze creative exploration for gaps" --json true
```

### **When to Use Which Pattern:**
- **Analysis-First:** Well-defined problems, technical decisions, risk assessment
- **Exploration-First:** Unclear problems, innovation needed, creative solutions
- **Both (Dual):** Critical decisions, complex problems, maximum confidence needed
